# Shared Library for kdb -> systemd Notify Mechanism

This repository provides a shared library that can be used to communicate with `systemd` to notify it of the lifecycle of a kdb process or application.

For more information on the `systemd` notification mechanism, see [the systemd documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_notify.html).

The related kdb library that uses this shared object can be found here - [https://github.com/jasraj/kdb-systemd](https://github.com/jasraj/kdb-systemd).
